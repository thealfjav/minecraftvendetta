This is a log of all of the messages generated by the WDL Companion plugin.
It can be used to quickly find who has WDL installed.  However, this should
*not* be used to ban players.  First off, WDL is mainly intended for making
backups of one's own creations.  Banning a player for that is not nice.  In
addition, the fact that a player appears here only means that they have the
mod installed, not that they used it on the server.  (Technically, it means
that the server received a 'WDL|INIT' plugin channel packet).  Finally, the
player wouldn't have been able to download on the server (unless the plugin
is configured to allow it, or they were manually exempted).

Some further information: 'WDL|INIT' is sent whenever the player has joined
the server, whenever they change worlds on the server (including going from
and to the nether and the end), and when the saving of a world is finished.
Please visit wiki.vg/Plugin_channels/World_downloader for more information.

If you want to disable this log, please set logType to 'none' in the plugin
config file.  The actual log begins below.
